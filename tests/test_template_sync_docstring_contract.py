"""The published tool docstring must not contradict the behaviour (0.3.5 item 2).

The migrate docstring promised project.md received "the region verbatim" while
build_project_md deliberately did the opposite and documented WHY in its own
docstring. Implementation right, published surface wrong -- and the surface is
what a caller reads: two consumer sessions read it, measured the artifact, and
documented the artifact over it. A stale docstring is not a cosmetic defect when
the thing it is wrong about is where a consumer's content lives.

These tests pin the two claims against each other, so the prose cannot drift
back on its own.
