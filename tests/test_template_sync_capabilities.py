"""Capability reporting on template_load_manifest.

A version is a proxy for a capability, and every proxy eventually disagrees
with the thing it stands for -- which is what this round demonstrated, when
0.3.1 was newer than 0.3.0 and equally unable to splice a region. A skill
should gate on `"region_splice" in capabilities`, never on version arithmetic.

**What these tests prove, and what they cannot.** Each name is paired with a
witness that exercises the behaviour the name claims, so a name that is
present but false fails here -- the risk the controller named. The converse,
"absent when unsupported", is not provable inside a build that supports
everything: nothing in this repository can produce a server lacking a
capability it ships. What stands in for it is `test_capability_set_is_exact`,
which fails the moment a name is added without a witness, so the list cannot
grow by accident into claims nobody checked.

The list is deliberately short. It carries the names a skill would branch on,
not an inventory of every field the server emits: better four names that can
be trusted than eleven that cannot. Names are permanent once published --
appended to, never renamed or removed, or the map becomes another drifting
proxy.
