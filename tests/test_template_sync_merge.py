"""Three-way merge tests for template_sync_mcp.

Regression coverage for the "merge silently drops lines" bug reported by a
consumer /sync-template run (panoscribe, 2026-08-29): `difflib` reports an
insertion as an opcode with `i1 == i2`, and the merge walk recorded that
opcode against base line `i1` -- a line that is *retained*, not changed.
The walk then emitted the inserted lines in place of `base_lines[i1]`,
dropping it, while still reporting `has_conflicts: false`.
